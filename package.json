  "description": "Totally Hitchin' Recreational Storage was started as a facility providing a service to the recreation community. However, it quickly became clear that there were more looking for storage, just a different kind. Totally Hitchinâ€™ has stepped up to the challenge and offers a negotiated price for the storage of these vehicles. If our prices seem low, it's because we are new and willing to negotiate.",
